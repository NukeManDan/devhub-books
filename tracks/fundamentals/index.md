# Main Track: Substrate Kitties

Based on: 
[https://github.com/shawntabrizi/substrate-collectables-workshop](https://github.com/shawntabrizi/substrate-collectables-workshop) rework for track model for devub.

Goal: Following the main track of the devhub, you go from zero to a final non-trivial substrate project for a stand alone, minimal, blochain and Dapp UI that is dedicated to:

- Establish Identity on chain
- Mint and trade (minmal, non-standard) NFTs

It will be extensible, as the base for further development in latter tracks:

- Parachain interaction with a relay chain for security, but more so for cross chain NFT transfers and more (eventually)
