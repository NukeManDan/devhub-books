# Runtime Engineering Overview

## FRAME Pallet Engineering Overview

- [https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/)
  - Presently used as a reference set of pages, not meant to be read linearly more than this one time , crosslinked throughout.
  - Vision: cater content to the runtime “branch” of content that most will follow after this main “trunk” of content in a linear flow. Put all "odd balls" in reference pages, and plan to insert into latter tracks
- Revisit Rust fundamentals in substrate context based on substrate kitties slides: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dhaoLb5V2K_vDe4EJlUcKwePD1nMktr57fOdSo8bHns/edit#slide=id.g51f30cead3_0_14](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dhaoLb5V2K_vDe4EJlUcKwePD1nMktr57fOdSo8bHns/edit#slide=id.g51f30cead3_0_14)
  - Include specific rust syntax examples and explanations that you need in rust along the way
  - Point to the [substrate example pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/example) for the comments with in depth explanations.
