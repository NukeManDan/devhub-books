# Overview of the Substrate Developer Hub

## Why Devhub?

Substrate is am immensely powerful tool for building blockchains. Devhub is a resource for becoming
a _substrate master_ with only minimal background required. For those new, to substrate, we
encourage you to checkout some
[awesome substrate based projects](https://www.substrate.io/substrate-users/) that show off just
some of what is possible.

## Structure & How-to Use

### 📚 Books

To help make the path to being a substrate master clear, the devhub is structured into many
**books** that are intended to be read from start to finish, indicated with the 📚 icon prefix.

These books are broken down into two primary sections:

1. Learn
2. Do

### 😺 Substrate Kitties 😺

The devhub team believes that one of the best ways to learn is _by doing_. And what better way to
learn than to build something fun! The examples throughout the documentation here indicated with the
😺 icon are part of the Substrate Kitties project that you will build as you progress through
various tracks

- tree structure, you are are the base! Ascend linearly to branches and leaves
- {do not have a “next steps” section, keep users on target}
- {all links open new tab, ideally keep devhub in focus}
