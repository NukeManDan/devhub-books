# Before You Dive Into Substrate...

Welcome to the wonderful world of blockchain development with Substrate! This is the Substrate Knowledge Base, the official documentation hub for Substrate developers. The purpose of this resource is to help readers understand the intricacies of blockchain development with Substrate. This guide is broken down into several sections that explain the principles and design decisions that Substrate is built on as well as the specific skills needed to be an effective Substrate blockchain developer.

    Some Expertise Needed

    In order to get the most out of Substrate, you should have a good knowledge of computer science and basic blockchain concepts. Terminology like header, block, client, hash, transaction and signature should be familiar. Substrate is built on the Rust programming language, which makes use of novel design patterns to enable development of code that is safe and fast. Although you don't need to know Rust to get started with Substrate, a good understanding of Rust will allow you to become a better Substrate developer. Check out the excellent resources provided by the Rust community to build your Rust development skills.

Substrate takes a modular approach to blockchain development and defines a rich set of primitives that allows developers to make use of powerful, familiar programming idioms.
